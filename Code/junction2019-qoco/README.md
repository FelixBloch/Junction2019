# THIS IS THE CUSTOMER SIDE FRONT-END CONCEPT FOR THE QOCO CHALLENGE AT JUNCTION 2019

## Some info

This basic app was created as a proof of concept supporting our idea for the QOCO challenge at Junction 2019.
We have taken and modyfied a template of Finnairs (one of QOCO's customers) website to integrate our concept.
The reaon behind this being, that our solution should be easily integrateable into any customers existing platform.

## Understanding the application

WIP

## How to use

This application was deployed on Heroku and can be found using this [link](https://junction2019-qoco.herokuapp.com/).
To keep it as simple as possible most buttons and links are not active. The navigation is simple.</br>
- On the home screen look for LUGGAGE on the navigation bar. This will led you [here](https://junction2019-qoco.herokuapp.com/luggage).</br>
Finally, on this page you have two options:</br>
- You can press FIND DROP OFF POINT to be led to the [page](https://junction2019-qoco.herokuapp.com/servicepoints) that allows you to find the closest luggage drop-off point to your location.</br>
- You can press DETAILS to be led to the [page](https://junction2019-qoco.herokuapp.com/luggageinfo) that allows you to track luggage using the latest info.
